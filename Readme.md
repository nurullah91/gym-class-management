# Gym Class Management

The Gym Class Scheduling and Membership Management System is designed to manage gym operations efficiently. The system defines three roles: Admin, Trainer, and Trainee, each with specific permissions. Admins are responsible for creating and managing trainers, scheduling classes, and assigning trainers to these schedules. Each day can have a maximum of five class schedules, with each class lasting two hours. Trainers conduct the classes and can view their assigned class schedules but cannot create new schedules or manage trainee profiles. Trainees can create and manage their own profiles and book class schedules if there is availability, with a maximum of ten trainees per schedule.

The system enforces several business rules to ensure smooth operations. Admins are limited to scheduling a maximum of 5 classes per day, and each schedule can accommodate no more than 10 trainees. If a class schedule reaches its capacity, trainees will be prevented from making further bookings, and admins cannot create additional schedules beyond the daily limit. JWT-based authentication is implemented to control access, ensuring that only authorized users can perform specific actions, such as booking classes or managing trainers. Robust error handling is integrated throughout the system, addressing issues such as unauthorized access, validation errors, and booking limit violations. This system provides an organized and flexible solution for managing gym class scheduling and membership, with well-defined roles and responsibilities.

**Three models are**

1. User Model
2. Schedule Model
3. Booking Model
